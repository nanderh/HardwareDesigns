## Raspberry Pi related PCBs
To connect multiple Pis to a single high current 5 Volt power supply I designed a simple distribution board to either 5 usb connectors or 5 screw terminals. Besides that there is space for smoothing capacitors, header connections to switch each connection separately, led indicators per connection and voltage test points.
Note: the main positive trace might seem quite large but it's designed for a maximum of 12A on a 1oz board.
